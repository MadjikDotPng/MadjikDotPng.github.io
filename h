Chorus  :
5
rose petal flowers
black thorn flowers
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 

crawlings much slower
moved my eyes lower
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 
9
rose petal flowers
dark night showers
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 

my words had power
shes a fucking coward
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 
Bridge:
13
sitting in her room
with the attitude
we'd be messed up by noon
immortality is lewd
 
but she doesn't listen
couldn't hear much
her eyes only glistened
when i felt her touch

Chorus:
17
rose petal flowers
black thorn flowers
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 

crawlings much slower
bring me lower 
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me? 
21
vomit up chowder
take a shower
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me?

you attach like a tick
the one you'd always lick
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me?
Bridge:
25
she's nic sick off the vape
i dont like to smoke
im not one to tie
another persons rope

she thinks livings lame
like living drains her power
she thinks its all a game
but she's really a fucking coward

Chorus pt. 1
29 
its winter i hope
the snow helps me cope
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me?

defiled herself with drugs
hanging out in clubs
why did you leave me?
why didn't you beleive me?

Chorus pt. 2
33 (loudly)
i offered her the help
but she said it hurt like hell 
she thought itd make her melt
and dramatically she fell

told her to get up off her bum
she'd end up in the tomb
but the one time she'd had fun
was in her mothers womb 

Chorus pt. 4
37 (mockingly)
But now she's in hell
But now she's in hell
How horrible she felt
How horrible she felt

But now she's in hell
But now she's in hell
She made her face melt
She made her face melt

41
